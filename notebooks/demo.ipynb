       "  AIMessage(content='## The Reign of the Sabre-Toothed Tiger: A Prehistoric Predator Unveiled\\n\\nFew prehistoric creatures capture the imagination quite like the saber-toothed tiger. With their fearsome, elongated canines, these magnificent beasts have become icons of the Ice Age, conjuring images of epic struggles against woolly mammoths and giant ground sloths. But beyond the popular imagery, what do we truly know about these incredible felids? Let\\'s delve into the fascinating world of *Smilodon*, the true name of the animal commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, and uncover the science behind its legendary status.\\n\\n### Not a True Tiger, But a Fierce Feline\\n\\nFirst things first: despite their common name, saber-toothed tigers were not direct ancestors of modern tigers. They belonged to an extinct subfamily of cats called Machairodontinae, often referred to as \"saber-toothed cats.\" While they shared a common ancestor with modern felines, their evolutionary path diverged significantly, leading to their unique and specialized adaptations. The most famous and well-studied genus of these formidable predators is *Smilodon*, which roamed the Americas from approximately 2.5 million years ago until their extinction around 11,700 years ago.\\n\\nThree main species of *Smilodon* are recognized:\\n*   ***Smilodon gracilis***: The earliest and smallest species, found in North America.\\n*   ***Smilodon fatalis***: A medium-sized species, widespread across North and South America. This is the species most commonly found in the La Brea Tar Pits.\\n*   ***Smilodon populator***: The largest and most robust species, exclusive to South America, possibly weighing up to 400 kg (880 lbs).\\n\\n### A Powerhouse of a Predator: Physical Characteristics\\n\\n*Smilodon* was a truly formidable animal, built for immense power rather than speed. Unlike the sleek, agile bodies of modern big cats, *Smilodon* possessed a heavily muscled, robust physique, particularly in its forelimbs and neck. This powerful build suggests an ambush predator, capable of overpowering large prey in a sudden, explosive attack. Their hindquarters were slightly shorter than their front, giving them a somewhat bear-like stance, and their tail was relatively short, further indicating a preference for power over agility in pursuit.\\n\\nBut, of course, the most striking feature was their teeth. The upper canine teeth of *Smilodon fatalis* could reach lengths of up to 18 cm (7 inches), while those of *Smilodon populator* could exceed 28 cm (11 inches) along their curve. These \"sabers\" were serrated along their edges, like steak knives, and were surprisingly delicate, not designed for gnawing on bone or prolonged struggles. This fragility points to a highly specialized killing technique. Interestingly, despite their massive fangs, *Smilodon* had a relatively weaker bite force compared to modern lions. This paradox suggests that their sabers were not used for a crushing bite, but rather for a precise, deep stab to the throat or belly of their prey, severing major blood vessels or trachea, leading to rapid incapacitation. Their jaws could open to an astonishing 120 degrees, allowing them to fully utilize their extraordinary weaponry.\\n\\n### Habitat and a Hunter\\'s Strategy\\n\\n*Smilodon* species were widespread across the Americas, adapting to various environments ranging from dense forests to open grasslands. Their distribution across such diverse landscapes highlights their adaptability, though they likely favored areas with ample cover for ambushing their large prey.\\n\\nTheir diet consisted primarily of large herbivores, including bison, horses, camels, giant ground sloths, and even young mammoths and mastodons. The sheer size and power of these prey animals suggest that *Smilodon* likely employed sophisticated hunting strategies. While initially thought to be solitary hunters, like most modern cats, mounting evidence, particularly from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, suggests a more complex social structure.\\n\\nThe tar pits, a natural trap for animals, have yielded an astonishing number of *Smilodon* fossils—far more than any other predator. This abundance, coupled with evidence of healed injuries on many *Smilodon* skeletons, suggests that these animals might have lived and hunted in groups. A solitary cat with a broken limb would likely starve, but if it had a pride to support it, it could recover. This social behavior would have been crucial for tackling the massive prey they targeted, allowing them to cooperate in bringing down animals much larger than themselves. The hunting strategy would likely involve an ambush, followed by a powerful pounce to bring the prey down, with the sabers then employed for a swift, precise killing blow to vital areas.\\n\\n### The Mystery of Their Disappearance\\n\\nThe reign of the saber-toothed tiger came to an end approximately 11,700 years ago, at the close of the last Ice Age, during a period known as the Quaternary extinction event. Their disappearance, along with that of many other megafauna, is a complex puzzle, likely attributed to a combination of factors:\\n\\n1.  **Climate Change:** The end of the Ice Age brought significant environmental shifts. Glaciers retreated, temperatures rose, and vast grasslands gave way to denser forests in some areas, while others became more arid. These changes impacted the habitats of *Smilodon*\\'s prey.\\n2.  **Decline of Large Prey:** As the climate changed, many of the large herbivores that formed the bulk of *Smilodon*\\'s diet began to disappear. Animals like mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths, and ancient horses faced their own challenges, and their dwindling numbers would have directly affected a specialized predator like *Smilodon*.\\n3.  **Competition with Humans:** The arrival and proliferation of early humans (Paleo-Indians) in the Americas coincided with the megafaunal extinction. Humans were highly efficient hunters, and it\\'s plausible that they competed with *Smilodon* for prey, or even directly hunted the same large animals, further contributing to the decline of the food source.\\n4.  **Specialization:** *Smilodon*\\'s highly specialized hunting technique, reliant on bringing down large, thick-skinned prey with its unique sabers, might have become a disadvantage as the availability of such prey diminished. They were less adaptable to hunting smaller, more agile animals that might have thrived in the changing environment.\\n\\n### A Lasting Legacy\\n\\nDespite their extinction, saber-toothed tigers continue to fascinate and inspire. They are a powerful reminder of the incredible diversity of life that has graced our planet and the dramatic shifts that have shaped its ecosystems. Paleontological discoveries, particularly from sites like the La Brea Tar Pits, continue to provide invaluable insights into their biology, behavior, and the world they inhabited.\\n\\nFrom fierce hunters of the Ice Age to enduring symbols of prehistoric power, the saber-toothed tiger remains a captivating enigma, a testament to the awe-inspiring adaptations that evolution can produce. Their story serves as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance of ecosystems and the profound impact of environmental change on even the most dominant predators.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--4e4cef03-31e2-4270-9190-53aba377aa04-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9826, 'output_tokens': 2122, 'total_tokens': 11948, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 8693}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 619}}),\n",

       "  ToolMessage(content='Page: Woolly mammoth\\nSummary: The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species of mammoth that lived from the Middle Pleistocene until its extinction in the Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with the African Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene.  The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 years ago in Siberia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) lived alongside the woolly mammoth in North America, and DNA studies show that the two hybridised with each other. Mammoth remains were long known in Asia before they became known to Europeans. The origin of these remains was long debated and often explained as the remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct elephant species by Georges Cuvier in 1796.\\nThe appearance and behaviour of the woolly mammoth are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North America, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. It was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.67 and 3.49 m (8 ft 9 in and 11 ft 5 in) and weighed between 3.9 and 8.2 t (3.8 and 8.1 long tons; 4.3 and 9.0 short tons). Females reached 2.3–2.6 m (7 ft 7 in – 8 ft 6 in) in shoulder heights and weighed between 2.8–4 t (2.8–3.9 long tons; 3.1–4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kg (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environments present during glacial periods, including the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who hunted the species for food, and used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings. The population of woolly mammoths declined at the end of the Late Pleistocene, with the last populations on mainland Siberia persisting until around 10,000 years ago, although isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. The completion of the mammoth genome project in 2015 sparked discussion about potentially reviving the woolly mammoth through several various methods. However, none of these approaches are currently feasible.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Revival of the woolly mammoth\\nSummary: The revival of the woolly mammoth is a proposed hypothetical that frozen soft-tissue remains and DNA from extinct woolly mammoths could be a means of regenerating the species. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this goal, including cloning, artificial insemination, and genome editing. Whether or not it is ethical to create a live mammoth is debated.\\nIn 2003, the Pyrenean ibex was briefly revived, giving credence to the idea that the mammoth could be successfully revived.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Mammoth\\nSummary: A mammoth is any species of the extinct elephantid genus Mammuthus.

Two subspecies are proposed, Aenocyon dirus guildayi and Aenocyon dirus dirus, but this assignment has been recently considered questionable. The largest collection of its fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.\\nDire wolf remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain areas of North America and the arid savanna of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to 2,255 meters (7,400 ft). Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42°N latitude; there have been only five unconfirmed records above this latitude. This range restriction is thought to be due to temperature, prey, or habitat limitations imposed by proximity to the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that existed at the time.\\nThe dire wolf was about the same size as the largest modern forms of gray wolf (Canis lupus): the Yukon wolf and the northwestern wolf. A. d. guildayi weighed on average 60 kilograms (132 lb) and A. d. dirus was on average 68 kg (150 lb). Its skull and dentition matched those of C. lupus, but its teeth were larger with greater shearing ability, and its bite force at the canine tooth was stronger than any known Canis species. These characteristics are thought to be adaptations for preying on Late Pleistocene megaherbivores; in North America, its prey is suggested to have included western horses, dwarf pronghorn, flat-headed peccary, ground sloths, ancient bison, and camels. Dire wolves lived as recently as 10,000 years ago, according to dated remains.

Understanding the nuances between them is key to truly appreciating the incredible saga of Earth and its inhabitants.\\\\n\\\\nAt first glance, it might seem like splitting hairs. Aren\\'t all Ice Age events prehistoric? And wasn\\'t prehistory dominated by ice? The answer is both yes and no. \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" is a much broader concept, encompassing a colossal span of time defined by the *absence of written records*. \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" on the other hand, refers to specific *climatic and geological conditions* characterized by widespread glaciation. While the most recent and famous Ice Age falls squarely within the prehistoric era, prehistory itself stretches far beyond the icy grip of glaciers, both before and after this frigid epoch.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s embark on a journey to disentangle these terms, exploring their individual definitions, their significant overlap, and their crucial distinctions.\\\\n\\\\n## The Grand Tapestry of Prehistory: Before the Pen Met Paper\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Prehistory\\\\\" is arguably one of the most expansive terms in human history, stretching from the very origins of the universe and the formation of Earth, or more commonly, from the emergence of life, all the way up to the invention of writing. For the purposes of understanding human history, it generally refers to the period from the appearance of the first hominins (our earliest ancestors) roughly 7 million years ago, to about 3,200 BCE, when the first complex writing systems emerged in Mesopotamia. This vast epoch is characterized by the absence of written documentation, forcing archaeologists, anthropologists, and paleontologists to piece together the story of life and human development through physical evidence: fossils, artifacts, tools, settlements, and environmental data.\\\\n\\\\nThe human segment of prehistory is traditionally divided into several ages, primarily based on the dominant material used for tools:\\\\n\\\\n*   **The Stone Age (roughly 3.4 million years ago \\\\u2013 2000 BCE):** This is the longest and most foundational period of human prehistory, further subdivided into:\\\\n    *   **Paleolithic (Old Stone Age):** The longest phase, spanning from the first stone tools to about 10,000 BCE. This era saw the evolution of various hominin species, including *Homo habilis*, *Homo erectus*, Neanderthals, and early *Homo sapiens*. It was defined by nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles, the mastery of fire, and the development of increasingly sophisticated stone tools. Crucially, much of the Upper Paleolithic occurred *during* the last Ice Age.\\\\n    *   **Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age):** A transitional period from about 10,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE (dates vary by region), following the end of the last Ice Age. Characterized by more diverse and specialized microlithic tools, adaptation to new post-glacial environments, and the beginnings of more settled lifestyles.\\\\n    *   **Neolithic (New Stone Age):** From about 8,000 BCE to 2,000 BCE, this era witnessed the most profound transformation in human history: the Agricultural Revolution. Humans began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to settled farming communities, the rise of villages and eventually cities, and the development of pottery and weaving. This period largely occurred *after* the last Ice Age.\\\\n*   **The Bronze Age (roughly 3300 BCE \\\\u2013 1200 BCE):** Marked by the discovery and widespread use of bronze for tools and weapons, leading to significant advancements in metallurgy, trade, and social complexity. Early forms of writing began to emerge in some regions during this period.\\\\n*   **The Iron Age (roughly 1200 BCE \\\\u2013 600 BCE onwards):** Characterized by the widespread use of iron, which was harder and more abundant than bronze, further revolutionizing technology, warfare, and societal structures. By this point, many civilizations had developed sophisticated writing systems, gradually bringing an end to the prehistoric era in various parts of the world.\\\\n\\\\nIn essence, prehistory is the story of humanity before written records, a narrative built from the silent whispers of stones, bones, and ancient landscapes. It\\\\u2019s about our origins, our evolution, our earliest innovations, and our profound adaptations to a constantly changing world.\\\\n\\\\n## The Frigid Grip of the Ice Age: A Climate Phenomenon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\" is a geological and climatic term, referring to a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth\\'s climate, resulting in an expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. It\\'s important to note that Earth has experienced multiple ice ages throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. We are, in fact, currently living in an ice age \\\\u2013 the Quaternary Glaciation \\\\u2013 which began about 2.58 million years ago and is characterized by alternating periods of extensive glaciation (glacial periods) and warmer, shorter periods (interglacial periods). We are currently in an interglacial period known as the Holocene.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when most people refer to \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" they are typically thinking of the last glacial period within the Quaternary Glaciation, which peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended roughly 11,700 years ago. This was a time of dramatic global cooling and environmental transformation:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Massive Ice Sheets:** Vast sheets of ice, sometimes miles thick, covered significant portions of North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Europe (the Scandinavian Ice Sheet), and Asia. These glaciers sculpted landscapes, carving out valleys and lakes.\\\\n*   **Lower Sea Levels:** With so much water locked up in ice, global sea levels dropped by as much as 120 meters (400 feet). This exposed vast land bridges, such as Beringia, which connected Asia and North America, facilitating human and animal migrations.\\\\n*   **Megafauna:** This era was the domain of magnificent megafauna, animals adapted to cold, harsh environments. Iconic species like the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats (Smilodon), and dire wolves roamed the vast, cold steppes and tundras. Their adaptations included thick fur, large body sizes to retain heat, and specialized diets.\\\\n*   **Climate and Vegetation:** Beyond the ice sheets, climates were generally colder and drier. Extensive areas of \\\\\"mammoth steppe\\\\\" \\\\u2013 a vast, cold grassland ecosystem \\\\u2013 stretched across Eurasia and North America, supporting the large grazing animals.\\\\n*   **Cycles of Advance and Retreat:** The Ice Age wasn\\'t a static block of ice; it was a dynamic period with numerous cycles of glacial advance (stadials) and retreat (interstadials) within the broader glacial periods.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ice Age was a force of nature that dramatically reshaped continents, drove evolutionary adaptations, and set the stage for the unique ecosystems that define our planet\\'s recent geological past.\\\\n\\\\n## The Intersection: Where Ice Age and Prehistory Converge\\\\n\\\\nNow that we\\'ve defined both terms, it becomes clear that the most recent and impactful Ice Age \\\\u2013 the last glacial period of the Quaternary Glaciation \\\\u2013 was a significant chapter *within* the larger book of human prehistory. Specifically, the latter half of the Paleolithic era (Upper Paleolithic) occurred when the world was firmly in the grip of glacial conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThis overlap is where the popular image of \\\\\"Ice Age humans\\\\\" comes from. Our direct ancestors, *Homo sapiens*, along with Neanderthals and other hominins, not only survived but thrived in these challenging environments. The Ice Age wasn\\'t just a backdrop; it was a powerful sculptor of human evolution, culture, and migration.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Human Adaptation and Innovation:** The intense cold spurred incredible ingenuity. Humans developed tailored clothing from animal hides, built sophisticated shelters (some using mammoth bones), mastered fire for warmth and cooking, and created specialized tools for hunting megafauna. The scarcity of resources and the need for communal effort likely fostered complex social structures.\\\\n*   **Migration Routes:** The lowered sea levels during glacial maxima opened up new pathways for human migration. The Bering Land Bridge, for instance, allowed early humans to cross from Asia into North America, populating an entirely new continent.\\\\n*   **Art and Symbolism:** The caves of Lascaux and Altamira, adorned with breathtaking paintings of mammoths, bison, horses, and other Ice Age animals, stand as enduring testaments to the artistic and symbolic capabilities of our prehistoric ancestors living during this frigid epoch. These artworks offer invaluable insights into their worldview, beliefs, and the animals that shaped their lives.\\\\n*   **Hunting Strategies:** Life during the Ice Age was inextricably linked to the megafauna. Hunter-gatherers developed sophisticated cooperative hunting techniques to bring down massive prey, utilizing spears, atlatls, and traps.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ice Age profoundly influenced where people lived, how they lived, what they ate, and what they believed. It was a crucible that forged many of the characteristics we associate with early human societies.\\\\n\\\\n## Distinguishing the Two: A Matter of Scope and Focus\\\\n\\\\nDespite their significant overlap, it\\'s crucial to understand the fundamental differences between \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Nature of the Term:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Primarily a *chronological* and *cultural* term, defined by the absence of written records and focusing on human development.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Primarily a *geological* and *climatic* term, defined by global temperature reduction and expanded glaciation.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Scope and Duration:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Encompasses a vast timeframe, from the dawn of humanity (or even earlier) to the invention of writing. It includes periods of warmth, cold, and everything in between. It is a continuous narrative of human development.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Refers to specific, albeit long, periods of Earth\\'s history characterized by glacial conditions. While the Quaternary Glaciation is ongoing, the *last glacial maximum* (what people usually mean by \\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\") was a distinct phase within this larger ice age. There have been multiple ice ages throughout Earth\\'s history, some long before humans even existed.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Primary Focus:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** The central focus is on *humans* \\\\u2013 their evolution, technology, social structures, art, and adaptation to their environments. The environment is a context for human activity.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** The central focus is on *environmental conditions* \\\\u2013 glaciers, climate, sea levels, and the megafauna and flora adapted to these conditions. Humans are one component of this broader ecological picture.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Chronological Relationship:**\\\\n    *   While the last major Ice Age occurred *within* the prehistoric period (specifically the Paleolithic), not all of prehistory was an Ice Age. For example, the Neolithic era, characterized by the rise of agriculture, is prehistoric but occurred *after* the last glacial maximum had ended and the climate had warmed considerably.\\\\n    *   Conversely, there were Ice Ages millions of years ago, long before any hominins existed, which were certainly not \\\\\"prehistoric\\\\\" in the human sense, though they were \\\\\"pre-written history\\\\\" for the Earth.\\\\n\\\\n## The End of an Era: Transition to the Holocene\\\\n\\\\nThe end of the last glacial period, around 11,700 years ago, marked a profound shift for both the planet and its human inhabitants. This transition, known as the Younger Dryas reversal in some regions, eventually led to the warming trend that ushered in the current interglacial period, the Holocene epoch. This climatic shift had immense consequences:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Melting Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels:** As the colossal ice sheets melted, vast amounts of water were released, causing global sea levels to rise dramatically. This submerged land bridges, reshaped coastlines, and created new inland seas and lakes.\\\\n*   **Environmental Change:** The mammoth steppes gave way to denser forests in many areas, and the tundras retreated northwards. This change in vegetation fundamentally altered the ecosystems that had supported the megafauna.\\\\n*   **Megafauna Extinctions:** Many of the iconic Ice Age megafauna, including woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and giant ground sloths, went extinct around this time. The exact causes are debated, but a combination of rapid climate change, habitat loss, and increased human hunting pressure likely played significant roles.\\\\n*   **Human Adaptation to a New World:** Humans, ever adaptable, responded to these changes. With the disappearance of large herd animals, hunting strategies shifted towards smaller, faster prey. The new forest environments provided different resources. This period of intense environmental change laid the groundwork for the most significant transformation in human prehistory: the Agricultural Revolution of the Neolithic era.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion: Two Lenses on a Shared Past\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, while the terms \\\\\"Ice Age\\\\\" and \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" are often used interchangeably in popular culture, they represent distinct but deeply intertwined concepts. \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" is the grand, overarching timeline of Earth and human history before the advent of writing, a vast canvas painted with the slow brushstrokes of evolution and cultural development. \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" particularly the last glacial period, is a specific, dramatic climatic event that occurred *within* that prehistoric canvas, profoundly shaping the landscapes, ecosystems, and the very trajectory of human survival and innovation.\\\\n\\\\nTo truly appreciate our ancient past, we must understand both. Prehistory provides the narrative of our ancestors\\' journey from simple hominins to complex societies. The Ice Age provides the dramatic environmental stage upon which much of that early human drama unfolded, challenging our ancestors and forging their resilience, ingenuity, and spirit. By distinguishing between these two powerful concepts, we gain a richer, more accurate understanding of the incredible story of life on Earth, and humanity\\'s remarkable place within it.\\\\n\", \"append\": false}'}}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--de27ecd0-cbed-46a1-80f4-9debaf0c812e-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'write_file', 'args': {'file_path': 'ice_age_vs_prehistoric_blog.txt', 'text': '\\n# Ice Age vs. Prehistoric: Unraveling Earth\\'s Ancient Past\\n\\nWhen we cast our minds back to a time before recorded history, images of colossal mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and early humans huddled around fires often come to mind.

It was a crucible that forged many of the characteristics we associate with early human societies.\\n\\n## Distinguishing the Two: A Matter of Scope and Focus\\n\\nDespite their significant overlap, it\\'s crucial to understand the fundamental differences between \"Prehistoric\" and \"The Ice Age\":\\n\\n1.  **Nature of the Term:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Primarily a *chronological* and *cultural* term, defined by the absence of written records and focusing on human development.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Primarily a *geological* and *climatic* term, defined by global temperature reduction and expanded glaciation.\\n\\n2.  **Scope and Duration:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Encompasses a vast timeframe, from the dawn of humanity (or even earlier) to the invention of writing. It includes periods of warmth, cold, and everything in between. It is a continuous narrative of human development.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Refers to specific, albeit long, periods of Earth\\'s history characterized by glacial conditions. While the Quaternary Glaciation is ongoing, the *last glacial maximum* (what people usually mean by \"The Ice Age\") was a distinct phase within this larger ice age. There have been multiple ice ages throughout Earth\\'s history, some long before humans even existed.\\n\\n3.  **Primary Focus:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** The central focus is on *humans* – their evolution, technology, social structures, art, and adaptation to their environments. The environment is a context for human activity.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** The central focus is on *environmental conditions* – glaciers, climate, sea levels, and the megafauna and flora adapted to these conditions. Humans are one component of this broader ecological picture.\\n\\n4.  **Chronological Relationship:**\\n    *   While the last major Ice Age occurred *within* the prehistoric period (specifically the Paleolithic), not all of prehistory was an Ice Age. For example, the Neolithic era, characterized by the rise of agriculture, is prehistoric but occurred *after* the last glacial maximum had ended and the climate had warmed considerably.\\n    *   Conversely, there were Ice Ages millions of years ago, long before any hominins existed, which were certainly not \"prehistoric\" in the human sense, though they were \"pre-written history\" for the Earth.\\n\\n## The End of an Era: Transition to the Holocene\\n\\nThe end of the last glacial period, around 11,700 years ago, marked a profound shift for both the planet and its human inhabitants. This transition, known as the Younger Dryas reversal in some regions, eventually led to the warming trend that ushered in the current interglacial period, the Holocene epoch. This climatic shift had immense consequences:\\n\\n*   **Melting Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels:** As the colossal ice sheets melted, vast amounts of water were released, causing global sea levels to rise dramatically. This submerged land bridges, reshaped coastlines, and created new inland seas and lakes.\\n*   **Environmental Change:** The mammoth steppes gave way to denser forests in many areas, and the tundras retreated northwards. This change in vegetation fundamentally altered the ecosystems that had supported the megafauna.\\n*   **Megafauna Extinctions:** Many of the iconic Ice Age megafauna, including woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and giant ground sloths, went extinct around this time. The exact causes are debated, but a combination of rapid climate change, habitat loss, and increased human hunting pressure likely played significant roles.\\n*   **Human Adaptation to a New World:** Humans, ever adaptable, responded to these changes. With the disappearance of large herd animals, hunting strategies shifted towards smaller, faster prey. The new forest environments provided different resources. This period of intense environmental change laid the groundwork for the most significant transformation in human prehistory: the Agricultural Revolution of the Neolithic era.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Two Lenses on a Shared Past\\n\\nIn summary, while the terms \"Ice Age\" and \"Prehistoric\" are often used interchangeably in popular culture, they represent distinct but deeply intertwined concepts. \"Prehistoric\" is the grand, overarching timeline of Earth and human history before the advent of writing, a vast canvas painted with the slow brushstrokes of evolution and cultural development. \"The Ice Age,\" particularly the last glacial period, is a specific, dramatic climatic event that occurred *within* that prehistoric canvas, profoundly shaping the landscapes, ecosystems, and the very trajectory of human survival and innovation.\\n\\nTo truly appreciate our ancient past, we must understand both. Prehistory provides the narrative of our ancestors\\' journey from simple hominins to complex societies. The Ice Age provides the dramatic environmental stage upon which much of that early human drama unfolded, challenging our ancestors and forging their resilience, ingenuity, and spirit. By distinguishing between these two powerful concepts, we gain a richer, more accurate understanding of the incredible story of life on Earth, and humanity\\'s remarkable place within it.\\n', 'append': False}, 'id': '3e67d3e5-b25a-4fc6-8ac0-58a493b427f4', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4556, 'output_tokens': 4292, 'total_tokens': 8848, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1177}})],\n",

These vivid snapshots are typically associated with two broad, often conflated, terms: \"The Ice Age\" and \"Prehistoric.\" While both evoke a sense of deep antiquity and a world vastly different from our own, they are not interchangeable. Understanding the nuances between them is key to truly appreciating the incredible saga of Earth and its inhabitants.\\n\\nAt first glance, it might seem like splitting hairs. Aren\\'t all Ice Age events prehistoric? And wasn\\'t prehistory dominated by ice? The answer is both yes and no. \"Prehistoric\" is a much broader concept, encompassing a colossal span of time defined by the *absence of written records*. \"The Ice Age,\" on the other hand, refers to specific *climatic and geological conditions* characterized by widespread glaciation. While the most recent and famous Ice Age falls squarely within the prehistoric era, prehistory itself stretches far beyond the icy grip of glaciers, both before and after this frigid epoch.\\n\\nLet\\'s embark on a journey to disentangle these terms, exploring their individual definitions, their significant overlap, and their crucial distinctions.\\n\\n## The Grand Tapestry of Prehistory: Before the Pen Met Paper\\n\\n\"Prehistory\" is arguably one of the most expansive terms in human history, stretching from the very origins of the universe and the formation of Earth, or more commonly, from the emergence of life, all the way up to the invention of writing. For the purposes of understanding human history, it generally refers to the period from the appearance of the first hominins (our earliest ancestors) roughly 7 million years ago, to about 3,200 BCE, when the first complex writing systems emerged in Mesopotamia. This vast epoch is characterized by the absence of written documentation, forcing archaeologists, anthropologists, and paleontologists to piece together the story of life and human development through physical evidence: fossils, artifacts, tools, settlements, and environmental data.\\n\\nThe human segment of prehistory is traditionally divided into several ages, primarily based on the dominant material used for tools:\\n\\n*   **The Stone Age (roughly 3.4 million years ago – 2000 BCE):** This is the longest and most foundational period of human prehistory, further subdivided into:\\n    *   **Paleolithic (Old Stone Age):** The longest phase, spanning from the first stone tools to about 10,000 BCE. This era saw the evolution of various hominin species, including *Homo habilis*, *Homo erectus*, Neanderthals, and early *Homo sapiens*. It was defined by nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles, the mastery of fire, and the development of increasingly sophisticated stone tools. Crucially, much of the Upper Paleolithic occurred *during* the last Ice Age.\\n    *   **Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age):** A transitional period from about 10,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE (dates vary by region), following the end of the last Ice Age. Characterized by more diverse and specialized microlithic tools, adaptation to new post-glacial environments, and the beginnings of more settled lifestyles.\\n    *   **Neolithic (New Stone Age):** From about 8,000 BCE to 2,000 BCE, this era witnessed the most profound transformation in human history: the Agricultural Revolution. Humans began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to settled farming communities, the rise of villages and eventually cities, and the development of pottery and weaving. This period largely occurred *after* the last Ice Age.\\n*   **The Bronze Age (roughly 3300 BCE – 1200 BCE):** Marked by the discovery and widespread use of bronze for tools and weapons, leading to significant advancements in metallurgy, trade, and social complexity. Early forms of writing began to emerge in some regions during this period.\\n*   **The Iron Age (roughly 1200 BCE – 600 BCE onwards):** Characterized by the widespread use of iron, which was harder and more abundant than bronze, further revolutionizing technology, warfare, and societal structures. By this point, many civilizations had developed sophisticated writing systems, gradually bringing an end to the prehistoric era in various parts of the world.\\n\\nIn essence, prehistory is the story of humanity before written records, a narrative built from the silent whispers of stones, bones, and ancient landscapes. It’s about our origins, our evolution, our earliest innovations, and our profound adaptations to a constantly changing world.\\n\\n## The Frigid Grip of the Ice Age: A Climate Phenomenon\\n\\n\"The Ice Age\" is a geological and climatic term, referring to a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth\\'s climate, resulting in an expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. It\\'s important to note that Earth has experienced multiple ice ages throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. We are, in fact, currently living in an ice age – the Quaternary Glaciation – which began about 2.58 million years ago and is characterized by alternating periods of extensive glaciation (glacial periods) and warmer, shorter periods (interglacial periods). We are currently in an interglacial period known as the Holocene.\\n\\nHowever, when most people refer to \"The Ice Age,\" they are typically thinking of the last glacial period within the Quaternary Glaciation, which peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended roughly 11,700 years ago. This was a time of dramatic global cooling and environmental transformation:\\n\\n*   **Massive Ice Sheets:** Vast sheets of ice, sometimes miles thick, covered significant portions of North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Europe (the Scandinavian Ice Sheet), and Asia. These glaciers sculpted landscapes, carving out valleys and lakes.\\n*   **Lower Sea Levels:** With so much water locked up in ice, global sea levels dropped by as much as 120 meters (400 feet). This exposed vast land bridges, such as Beringia, which connected Asia and North America, facilitating human and animal migrations.\\n*   **Megafauna:** This era was the domain of magnificent megafauna, animals adapted to cold, harsh environments. Iconic species like the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats (Smilodon), and dire wolves roamed the vast, cold steppes and tundras. Their adaptations included thick fur, large body sizes to retain heat, and specialized diets.\\n*   **Climate and Vegetation:** Beyond the ice sheets, climates were generally colder and drier. Extensive areas of \"mammoth steppe\" – a vast, cold grassland ecosystem – stretched across Eurasia and North America, supporting the large grazing animals.\\n*   **Cycles of Advance and Retreat:** The Ice Age wasn\\'t a static block of ice; it was a dynamic period with numerous cycles of glacial advance (stadials) and retreat (interstadials) within the broader glacial periods.\\n\\nThe Ice Age was a force of nature that dramatically reshaped continents, drove evolutionary adaptations, and set the stage for the unique ecosystems that define our planet\\'s recent geological past.\\n\\n## The Intersection: Where Ice Age and Prehistory Converge\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve defined both terms, it becomes clear that the most recent and impactful Ice Age – the last glacial period of the Quaternary Glaciation – was a significant chapter *within* the larger book of human prehistory. Specifically, the latter half of the Paleolithic era (Upper Paleolithic) occurred when the world was firmly in the grip of glacial conditions.\\n\\nThis overlap is where the popular image of \"Ice Age humans\" comes from. Our direct ancestors, *Homo sapiens*, along with Neanderthals and other hominins, not only survived but thrived in these challenging environments. The Ice Age wasn\\'t just a backdrop; it was a powerful sculptor of human evolution, culture, and migration.\\n\\n*   **Human Adaptation and Innovation:** The intense cold spurred incredible ingenuity. Humans developed tailored clothing from animal hides, built sophisticated shelters (some using mammoth bones), mastered fire for warmth and cooking, and created specialized tools for hunting megafauna. The scarcity of resources and the need for communal effort likely fostered complex social structures.\\n*   **Migration Routes:** The lowered sea levels during glacial maxima opened up new pathways for human migration. The Bering Land Bridge, for instance, allowed early humans to cross from Asia into North America, populating an entirely new continent.\\n*   **Art and Symbolism:** The caves of Lascaux and Altamira, adorned with breathtaking paintings of mammoths, bison, horses, and other Ice Age animals, stand as enduring testaments to the artistic and symbolic capabilities of our prehistoric ancestors living during this frigid epoch. These artworks offer invaluable insights into their worldview, beliefs, and the animals that shaped their lives.\\n*   **Hunting Strategies:** Life during the Ice Age was inextricably linked to the megafauna. Hunter-gatherers developed sophisticated cooperative hunting techniques to bring down massive prey, utilizing spears, atlatls, and traps.\\n\\nThe Ice Age profoundly influenced where people lived, how they lived, what they ate, and what they believed. It was a crucible that forged many of the characteristics we associate with early human societies.\\n\\n## Distinguishing the Two: A Matter of Scope and Focus\\n\\nDespite their significant overlap, it\\'s crucial to understand the fundamental differences between \"Prehistoric\" and \"The Ice Age\":\\n\\n1.  **Nature of the Term:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Primarily a *chronological* and *cultural* term, defined by the absence of written records and focusing on human development.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Primarily a *geological* and *climatic* term, defined by global temperature reduction and expanded glaciation.\\n\\n2.  **Scope and Duration:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Encompasses a vast timeframe, from the dawn of humanity (or even earlier) to the invention of writing.

While artificial intelligence (AI)\\nmodels have shown promising results in analyzing individual data modalities,\\nthere is increasing recognition that models integrating multiple complementary\\ndata sources, so-called multimodal AI, could enhance clinical decision-making.\\nThis scoping review examines the landscape of deep learning-based multimodal AI\\napplications across the medical domain, analyzing 432 papers published between\\n2018 and 2024. We provide an extensive overview of multimodal AI development\\nacross different medical disciplines, examining various architectural\\napproaches, fusion strategies, and common application areas. Our analysis\\nreveals that multimodal AI models consistently outperform their unimodal\\ncounterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2 percentage points in AUC.\\nHowever, several challenges persist, including cross-departmental coordination,\\nheterogeneous data characteristics, and incomplete datasets. We critically\\nassess the technical and practical challenges in developing multimodal AI\\nsystems and discuss potential strategies for their clinical implementation,\\nincluding a brief overview of commercially available multimodal AI models for\\nclinical decision-making. Additionally, we identify key factors driving\\nmultimodal AI development and propose recommendations to accelerate the field's\\nmaturation.

Despite its effectiveness, understanding the\\nunderlying mechanism of multimodal pre-training models still remains a grand\\nchallenge. Revealing the explainability of such models is likely to enable\\nbreakthroughs of novel learning paradigms in the AI field. To this end, given\\nthe multimodal nature of the human brain, we propose to explore the\\nexplainability of multimodal learning models with the aid of non-invasive brain\\nimaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\\nConcretely, we first present a newly-designed multimodal foundation model\\npre-trained on 15 million image-text pairs, which has shown strong multimodal\\nunderstanding and generalization abilities in a variety of cognitive downstream\\ntasks. Further, from the perspective of neural encoding (based on our\\nfoundation model), we find that both visual and lingual encoders trained\\nmultimodally are more brain-like compared with unimodal ones. Particularly, we\\nidentify a number of brain regions where multimodally-trained encoders\\ndemonstrate better neural encoding performance. This is consistent with the\\nfindings in existing studies on exploring brain multi-sensory integration.\\nTherefore, we believe that multimodal foundation models are more suitable tools\\nfor neuroscientists to study the multimodal signal processing mechanisms in the\\nhuman brain. Our findings also demonstrate the potential of multimodal\\nfoundation models as ideal computational simulators to promote both\\nAI-for-brain and brain-for-AI research.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08263v1\\nPDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08263v1\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTitle: Multimodal Conversational AI: A Survey of Datasets and Approaches\\nAuthors: Anirudh Sundar,Larry Heck\\nPublished: 2022-05-13\\nAbstract: As humans, we experience the world with all our senses or modalities (sound,\\nsight, touch, smell, and taste). We use these modalities, particularly sight\\nand touch, to convey and interpret specific meanings. Multimodal expressions\\nare central to conversations; a rich set of modalities amplify and often\\ncompensate for each other. A multimodal conversational AI system answers\\nquestions, fulfills tasks, and emulates human conversations by understanding\\nand expressing itself via multiple modalities. This paper motivates, defines,\\nand mathematically formulates the multimodal conversational research objective.\\nWe provide a taxonomy of research required to solve the objective: multimodal\\nrepresentation, fusion, alignment, translation, and co-learning. We survey\\nstate-of-the-art datasets and approaches for each research area and highlight\\ntheir limiting assumptions. Finally, we identify multimodal co-learning as a\\npromising direction for multimodal conversational AI research.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06907v1\\nPDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06907v1\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTitle: Towards a Multimodal Document-grounded Conversational AI System for Education\\nAuthors: Karan Taneja,Anjali Singh,Ashok K. Goel\\nPublished: 2025-04-04\\nAbstract: Multimedia learning using text and images has been shown to improve learning\\noutcomes compared to text-only instruction. But conversational AI systems in\\neducation predominantly rely on text-based interactions while multimodal\\nconversations for multimedia learning remain unexplored. Moreover, deploying\\nconversational AI in learning contexts requires grounding in reliable sources\\nand verifiability to create trust. We present MuDoC, a Multimodal\\nDocument-grounded Conversational AI system based on GPT-4o, that leverages both\\ntext and visuals from documents to generate responses interleaved with text and\\nimages. Its interface allows verification of AI generated content through\\nseamless navigation to the source. We compare MuDoC to a text-only system to\\nexplore differences in learner engagement, trust in AI system, and their\\nperformance on problem-solving tasks. Our findings indicate that both visuals\\nand verifiability of content enhance learner engagement and foster trust;\\nhowever, no significant impact in performance was observed. We draw upon\\ntheories from cognitive and learning sciences to interpret the findings and\\nderive implications, and outline future directions for the development of\\nmultimodal conversational AI systems in education.\\nLink: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13884v1\\nPDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13884v1\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\", name='arxiv_search', id='6d5d51b1-d0c6-4b03-a0f5-03aef8120dbb', tool_call_id='46d7af1f-d1d4-49b5-afb1-54ea0d9fd75c'), AIMessage(content=\"Here are the latest research findings on multimodal AI:\\n\\n*   **Industrial CAD Modeling:** Research from March 2025 explores AI-driven multimodal interfaces to improve 3D CAD modeling workflows and user experience.

It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with the African Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene.  The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 years ago in Siberia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) lived alongside the woolly mammoth in North America, and DNA studies show that the two hybridised with each other. Mammoth remains were long known in Asia before they became known to Europeans. The origin of these remains was long debated and often explained as the remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct elephant species by Georges Cuvier in 1796.\\nThe appearance and behaviour of the woolly mammoth are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North America, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. It was roughly the same size as modern African elephants. Males reached shoulder heights between 2.67 and 3.49 m (8 ft 9 in and 11 ft 5 in) and weighed between 3.9 and 8.2 t (3.8 and 8.1 long tons; 4.3 and 9.0 short tons). Females reached 2.3–2.6 m (7 ft 7 in – 8 ft 6 in) in shoulder heights and weighed between 2.8–4 t (2.8–3.9 long tons; 3.1–4.4 short tons). A newborn calf weighed about 90 kg (200 lb). The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environments present during glacial periods, including the last ice age. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the coat varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss. It had long, curved tusks and four molars, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and sedges. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the mammoth steppe, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.\\nThe woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who hunted the species for food, and used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings. The population of woolly mammoths declined at the end of the Late Pleistocene, with the last populations on mainland Siberia persisting until around 10,000 years ago, although isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. The completion of the mammoth genome project in 2015 sparked discussion about potentially reviving the woolly mammoth through several various methods. However, none of these approaches are currently feasible.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Revival of the woolly mammoth\\nSummary: The revival of the woolly mammoth is a proposed hypothetical that frozen soft-tissue remains and DNA from extinct woolly mammoths could be a means of regenerating the species. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this goal, including cloning, artificial insemination, and genome editing.

The sites range in elevation from sea level to 2,255 meters (7,400 ft). Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of 42°N latitude; there have been only five unconfirmed records above this latitude.

Understanding the nuances between them is key to truly appreciating the incredible saga of Earth and its inhabitants.\\\\n\\\\nAt first glance, it might seem like splitting hairs. Aren\\'t all Ice Age events prehistoric? And wasn\\'t prehistory dominated by ice? The answer is both yes and no. \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" is a much broader concept, encompassing a colossal span of time defined by the *absence of written records*. \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" on the other hand, refers to specific *climatic and geological conditions* characterized by widespread glaciation. While the most recent and famous Ice Age falls squarely within the prehistoric era, prehistory itself stretches far beyond the icy grip of glaciers, both before and after this frigid epoch.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\'s embark on a journey to disentangle these terms, exploring their individual definitions, their significant overlap, and their crucial distinctions.\\\\n\\\\n## The Grand Tapestry of Prehistory: Before the Pen Met Paper\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Prehistory\\\\\" is arguably one of the most expansive terms in human history, stretching from the very origins of the universe and the formation of Earth, or more commonly, from the emergence of life, all the way up to the invention of writing. For the purposes of understanding human history, it generally refers to the period from the appearance of the first hominins (our earliest ancestors) roughly 7 million years ago, to about 3,200 BCE, when the first complex writing systems emerged in Mesopotamia. This vast epoch is characterized by the absence of written documentation, forcing archaeologists, anthropologists, and paleontologists to piece together the story of life and human development through physical evidence: fossils, artifacts, tools, settlements, and environmental data.\\\\n\\\\nThe human segment of prehistory is traditionally divided into several ages, primarily based on the dominant material used for tools:\\\\n\\\\n*   **The Stone Age (roughly 3.4 million years ago \\\\u2013 2000 BCE):** This is the longest and most foundational period of human prehistory, further subdivided into:\\\\n    *   **Paleolithic (Old Stone Age):** The longest phase, spanning from the first stone tools to about 10,000 BCE. This era saw the evolution of various hominin species, including *Homo habilis*, *Homo erectus*, Neanderthals, and early *Homo sapiens*. It was defined by nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles, the mastery of fire, and the development of increasingly sophisticated stone tools. Crucially, much of the Upper Paleolithic occurred *during* the last Ice Age.\\\\n    *   **Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age):** A transitional period from about 10,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE (dates vary by region), following the end of the last Ice Age. Characterized by more diverse and specialized microlithic tools, adaptation to new post-glacial environments, and the beginnings of more settled lifestyles.\\\\n    *   **Neolithic (New Stone Age):** From about 8,000 BCE to 2,000 BCE, this era witnessed the most profound transformation in human history: the Agricultural Revolution. Humans began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to settled farming communities, the rise of villages and eventually cities, and the development of pottery and weaving. This period largely occurred *after* the last Ice Age.\\\\n*   **The Bronze Age (roughly 3300 BCE \\\\u2013 1200 BCE):** Marked by the discovery and widespread use of bronze for tools and weapons, leading to significant advancements in metallurgy, trade, and social complexity. Early forms of writing began to emerge in some regions during this period.\\\\n*   **The Iron Age (roughly 1200 BCE \\\\u2013 600 BCE onwards):** Characterized by the widespread use of iron, which was harder and more abundant than bronze, further revolutionizing technology, warfare, and societal structures. By this point, many civilizations had developed sophisticated writing systems, gradually bringing an end to the prehistoric era in various parts of the world.\\\\n\\\\nIn essence, prehistory is the story of humanity before written records, a narrative built from the silent whispers of stones, bones, and ancient landscapes. It\\\\u2019s about our origins, our evolution, our earliest innovations, and our profound adaptations to a constantly changing world.\\\\n\\\\n## The Frigid Grip of the Ice Age: A Climate Phenomenon\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\" is a geological and climatic term, referring to a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth\\'s climate, resulting in an expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. It\\'s important to note that Earth has experienced multiple ice ages throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. We are, in fact, currently living in an ice age \\\\u2013 the Quaternary Glaciation \\\\u2013 which began about 2.58 million years ago and is characterized by alternating periods of extensive glaciation (glacial periods) and warmer, shorter periods (interglacial periods). We are currently in an interglacial period known as the Holocene.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when most people refer to \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" they are typically thinking of the last glacial period within the Quaternary Glaciation, which peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended roughly 11,700 years ago. This was a time of dramatic global cooling and environmental transformation:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Massive Ice Sheets:** Vast sheets of ice, sometimes miles thick, covered significant portions of North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Europe (the Scandinavian Ice Sheet), and Asia. These glaciers sculpted landscapes, carving out valleys and lakes.\\\\n*   **Lower Sea Levels:** With so much water locked up in ice, global sea levels dropped by as much as 120 meters (400 feet). This exposed vast land bridges, such as Beringia, which connected Asia and North America, facilitating human and animal migrations.\\\\n*   **Megafauna:** This era was the domain of magnificent megafauna, animals adapted to cold, harsh environments. Iconic species like the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats (Smilodon), and dire wolves roamed the vast, cold steppes and tundras. Their adaptations included thick fur, large body sizes to retain heat, and specialized diets.\\\\n*   **Climate and Vegetation:** Beyond the ice sheets, climates were generally colder and drier. Extensive areas of \\\\\"mammoth steppe\\\\\" \\\\u2013 a vast, cold grassland ecosystem \\\\u2013 stretched across Eurasia and North America, supporting the large grazing animals.\\\\n*   **Cycles of Advance and Retreat:** The Ice Age wasn\\'t a static block of ice; it was a dynamic period with numerous cycles of glacial advance (stadials) and retreat (interstadials) within the broader glacial periods.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ice Age was a force of nature that dramatically reshaped continents, drove evolutionary adaptations, and set the stage for the unique ecosystems that define our planet\\'s recent geological past.\\\\n\\\\n## The Intersection: Where Ice Age and Prehistory Converge\\\\n\\\\nNow that we\\'ve defined both terms, it becomes clear that the most recent and impactful Ice Age \\\\u2013 the last glacial period of the Quaternary Glaciation \\\\u2013 was a significant chapter *within* the larger book of human prehistory. Specifically, the latter half of the Paleolithic era (Upper Paleolithic) occurred when the world was firmly in the grip of glacial conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThis overlap is where the popular image of \\\\\"Ice Age humans\\\\\" comes from. Our direct ancestors, *Homo sapiens*, along with Neanderthals and other hominins, not only survived but thrived in these challenging environments. The Ice Age wasn\\'t just a backdrop; it was a powerful sculptor of human evolution, culture, and migration.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Human Adaptation and Innovation:** The intense cold spurred incredible ingenuity. Humans developed tailored clothing from animal hides, built sophisticated shelters (some using mammoth bones), mastered fire for warmth and cooking, and created specialized tools for hunting megafauna. The scarcity of resources and the need for communal effort likely fostered complex social structures.\\\\n*   **Migration Routes:** The lowered sea levels during glacial maxima opened up new pathways for human migration. The Bering Land Bridge, for instance, allowed early humans to cross from Asia into North America, populating an entirely new continent.\\\\n*   **Art and Symbolism:** The caves of Lascaux and Altamira, adorned with breathtaking paintings of mammoths, bison, horses, and other Ice Age animals, stand as enduring testaments to the artistic and symbolic capabilities of our prehistoric ancestors living during this frigid epoch. These artworks offer invaluable insights into their worldview, beliefs, and the animals that shaped their lives.\\\\n*   **Hunting Strategies:** Life during the Ice Age was inextricably linked to the megafauna. Hunter-gatherers developed sophisticated cooperative hunting techniques to bring down massive prey, utilizing spears, atlatls, and traps.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ice Age profoundly influenced where people lived, how they lived, what they ate, and what they believed. It was a crucible that forged many of the characteristics we associate with early human societies.\\\\n\\\\n## Distinguishing the Two: A Matter of Scope and Focus\\\\n\\\\nDespite their significant overlap, it\\'s crucial to understand the fundamental differences between \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Nature of the Term:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Primarily a *chronological* and *cultural* term, defined by the absence of written records and focusing on human development.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Primarily a *geological* and *climatic* term, defined by global temperature reduction and expanded glaciation.\\\\n\\\\n2.  **Scope and Duration:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Encompasses a vast timeframe, from the dawn of humanity (or even earlier) to the invention of writing. It includes periods of warmth, cold, and everything in between. It is a continuous narrative of human development.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Refers to specific, albeit long, periods of Earth\\'s history characterized by glacial conditions. While the Quaternary Glaciation is ongoing, the *last glacial maximum* (what people usually mean by \\\\\"The Ice Age\\\\\") was a distinct phase within this larger ice age. There have been multiple ice ages throughout Earth\\'s history, some long before humans even existed.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Primary Focus:**\\\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** The central focus is on *humans* \\\\u2013 their evolution, technology, social structures, art, and adaptation to their environments. The environment is a context for human activity.\\\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** The central focus is on *environmental conditions* \\\\u2013 glaciers, climate, sea levels, and the megafauna and flora adapted to these conditions. Humans are one component of this broader ecological picture.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Chronological Relationship:**\\\\n    *   While the last major Ice Age occurred *within* the prehistoric period (specifically the Paleolithic), not all of prehistory was an Ice Age. For example, the Neolithic era, characterized by the rise of agriculture, is prehistoric but occurred *after* the last glacial maximum had ended and the climate had warmed considerably.\\\\n    *   Conversely, there were Ice Ages millions of years ago, long before any hominins existed, which were certainly not \\\\\"prehistoric\\\\\" in the human sense, though they were \\\\\"pre-written history\\\\\" for the Earth.\\\\n\\\\n## The End of an Era: Transition to the Holocene\\\\n\\\\nThe end of the last glacial period, around 11,700 years ago, marked a profound shift for both the planet and its human inhabitants. This transition, known as the Younger Dryas reversal in some regions, eventually led to the warming trend that ushered in the current interglacial period, the Holocene epoch. This climatic shift had immense consequences:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Melting Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels:** As the colossal ice sheets melted, vast amounts of water were released, causing global sea levels to rise dramatically. This submerged land bridges, reshaped coastlines, and created new inland seas and lakes.\\\\n*   **Environmental Change:** The mammoth steppes gave way to denser forests in many areas, and the tundras retreated northwards. This change in vegetation fundamentally altered the ecosystems that had supported the megafauna.\\\\n*   **Megafauna Extinctions:** Many of the iconic Ice Age megafauna, including woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and giant ground sloths, went extinct around this time. The exact causes are debated, but a combination of rapid climate change, habitat loss, and increased human hunting pressure likely played significant roles.\\\\n*   **Human Adaptation to a New World:** Humans, ever adaptable, responded to these changes. With the disappearance of large herd animals, hunting strategies shifted towards smaller, faster prey. The new forest environments provided different resources. This period of intense environmental change laid the groundwork for the most significant transformation in human prehistory: the Agricultural Revolution of the Neolithic era.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion: Two Lenses on a Shared Past\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, while the terms \\\\\"Ice Age\\\\\" and \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" are often used interchangeably in popular culture, they represent distinct but deeply intertwined concepts. \\\\\"Prehistoric\\\\\" is the grand, overarching timeline of Earth and human history before the advent of writing, a vast canvas painted with the slow brushstrokes of evolution and cultural development. \\\\\"The Ice Age,\\\\\" particularly the last glacial period, is a specific, dramatic climatic event that occurred *within* that prehistoric canvas, profoundly shaping the landscapes, ecosystems, and the very trajectory of human survival and innovation.\\\\n\\\\nTo truly appreciate our ancient past, we must understand both. Prehistory provides the narrative of our ancestors\\' journey from simple hominins to complex societies. The Ice Age provides the dramatic environmental stage upon which much of that early human drama unfolded, challenging our ancestors and forging their resilience, ingenuity, and spirit. By distinguishing between these two powerful concepts, we gain a richer, more accurate understanding of the incredible story of life on Earth, and humanity\\'s remarkable place within it.\\\\n\", \"append\": false}'}}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--de27ecd0-cbed-46a1-80f4-9debaf0c812e-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'write_file', 'args': {'file_path': 'ice_age_vs_prehistoric_blog.txt', 'text': '\\n# Ice Age vs. Prehistoric: Unraveling Earth\\'s Ancient Past\\n\\nWhen we cast our minds back to a time before recorded history, images of colossal mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and early humans huddled around fires often come to mind.

This period largely occurred *after* the last Ice Age.\\n*   **The Bronze Age (roughly 3300 BCE – 1200 BCE):** Marked by the discovery and widespread use of bronze for tools and weapons, leading to significant advancements in metallurgy, trade, and social complexity. Early forms of writing began to emerge in some regions during this period.\\n*   **The Iron Age (roughly 1200 BCE – 600 BCE onwards):** Characterized by the widespread use of iron, which was harder and more abundant than bronze, further revolutionizing technology, warfare, and societal structures. By this point, many civilizations had developed sophisticated writing systems, gradually bringing an end to the prehistoric era in various parts of the world.\\n\\nIn essence, prehistory is the story of humanity before written records, a narrative built from the silent whispers of stones, bones, and ancient landscapes. It’s about our origins, our evolution, our earliest innovations, and our profound adaptations to a constantly changing world.\\n\\n## The Frigid Grip of the Ice Age: A Climate Phenomenon\\n\\n\"The Ice Age\" is a geological and climatic term, referring to a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth\\'s climate, resulting in an expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. It\\'s important to note that Earth has experienced multiple ice ages throughout its 4.5-billion-year history. We are, in fact, currently living in an ice age – the Quaternary Glaciation – which began about 2.58 million years ago and is characterized by alternating periods of extensive glaciation (glacial periods) and warmer, shorter periods (interglacial periods). We are currently in an interglacial period known as the Holocene.\\n\\nHowever, when most people refer to \"The Ice Age,\" they are typically thinking of the last glacial period within the Quaternary Glaciation, which peaked around 20,000 years ago and ended roughly 11,700 years ago. This was a time of dramatic global cooling and environmental transformation:\\n\\n*   **Massive Ice Sheets:** Vast sheets of ice, sometimes miles thick, covered significant portions of North America (the Laurentide Ice Sheet), Europe (the Scandinavian Ice Sheet), and Asia. These glaciers sculpted landscapes, carving out valleys and lakes.\\n*   **Lower Sea Levels:** With so much water locked up in ice, global sea levels dropped by as much as 120 meters (400 feet). This exposed vast land bridges, such as Beringia, which connected Asia and North America, facilitating human and animal migrations.\\n*   **Megafauna:** This era was the domain of magnificent megafauna, animals adapted to cold, harsh environments. Iconic species like the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, giant ground sloths, saber-toothed cats (Smilodon), and dire wolves roamed the vast, cold steppes and tundras. Their adaptations included thick fur, large body sizes to retain heat, and specialized diets.\\n*   **Climate and Vegetation:** Beyond the ice sheets, climates were generally colder and drier. Extensive areas of \"mammoth steppe\" – a vast, cold grassland ecosystem – stretched across Eurasia and North America, supporting the large grazing animals.\\n*   **Cycles of Advance and Retreat:** The Ice Age wasn\\'t a static block of ice; it was a dynamic period with numerous cycles of glacial advance (stadials) and retreat (interstadials) within the broader glacial periods.\\n\\nThe Ice Age was a force of nature that dramatically reshaped continents, drove evolutionary adaptations, and set the stage for the unique ecosystems that define our planet\\'s recent geological past.\\n\\n## The Intersection: Where Ice Age and Prehistory Converge\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve defined both terms, it becomes clear that the most recent and impactful Ice Age – the last glacial period of the Quaternary Glaciation – was a significant chapter *within* the larger book of human prehistory. Specifically, the latter half of the Paleolithic era (Upper Paleolithic) occurred when the world was firmly in the grip of glacial conditions.\\n\\nThis overlap is where the popular image of \"Ice Age humans\" comes from. Our direct ancestors, *Homo sapiens*, along with Neanderthals and other hominins, not only survived but thrived in these challenging environments. The Ice Age wasn\\'t just a backdrop; it was a powerful sculptor of human evolution, culture, and migration.\\n\\n*   **Human Adaptation and Innovation:** The intense cold spurred incredible ingenuity. Humans developed tailored clothing from animal hides, built sophisticated shelters (some using mammoth bones), mastered fire for warmth and cooking, and created specialized tools for hunting megafauna. The scarcity of resources and the need for communal effort likely fostered complex social structures.\\n*   **Migration Routes:** The lowered sea levels during glacial maxima opened up new pathways for human migration. The Bering Land Bridge, for instance, allowed early humans to cross from Asia into North America, populating an entirely new continent.\\n*   **Art and Symbolism:** The caves of Lascaux and Altamira, adorned with breathtaking paintings of mammoths, bison, horses, and other Ice Age animals, stand as enduring testaments to the artistic and symbolic capabilities of our prehistoric ancestors living during this frigid epoch. These artworks offer invaluable insights into their worldview, beliefs, and the animals that shaped their lives.\\n*   **Hunting Strategies:** Life during the Ice Age was inextricably linked to the megafauna. Hunter-gatherers developed sophisticated cooperative hunting techniques to bring down massive prey, utilizing spears, atlatls, and traps.\\n\\nThe Ice Age profoundly influenced where people lived, how they lived, what they ate, and what they believed. It was a crucible that forged many of the characteristics we associate with early human societies.\\n\\n## Distinguishing the Two: A Matter of Scope and Focus\\n\\nDespite their significant overlap, it\\'s crucial to understand the fundamental differences between \"Prehistoric\" and \"The Ice Age\":\\n\\n1.  **Nature of the Term:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Primarily a *chronological* and *cultural* term, defined by the absence of written records and focusing on human development.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Primarily a *geological* and *climatic* term, defined by global temperature reduction and expanded glaciation.\\n\\n2.  **Scope and Duration:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** Encompasses a vast timeframe, from the dawn of humanity (or even earlier) to the invention of writing. It includes periods of warmth, cold, and everything in between. It is a continuous narrative of human development.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** Refers to specific, albeit long, periods of Earth\\'s history characterized by glacial conditions. While the Quaternary Glaciation is ongoing, the *last glacial maximum* (what people usually mean by \"The Ice Age\") was a distinct phase within this larger ice age. There have been multiple ice ages throughout Earth\\'s history, some long before humans even existed.\\n\\n3.  **Primary Focus:**\\n    *   **Prehistoric:** The central focus is on *humans* – their evolution, technology, social structures, art, and adaptation to their environments. The environment is a context for human activity.\\n    *   **The Ice Age:** The central focus is on *environmental conditions* – glaciers, climate, sea levels, and the megafauna and flora adapted to these conditions. Humans are one component of this broader ecological picture.\\n\\n4.  **Chronological Relationship:**\\n    *   While the last major Ice Age occurred *within* the prehistoric period (specifically the Paleolithic), not all of prehistory was an Ice Age. For example, the Neolithic era, characterized by the rise of agriculture, is prehistoric but occurred *after* the last glacial maximum had ended and the climate had warmed considerably.\\n    *   Conversely, there were Ice Ages millions of years ago, long before any hominins existed, which were certainly not \"prehistoric\" in the human sense, though they were \"pre-written history\" for the Earth.\\n\\n## The End of an Era: Transition to the Holocene\\n\\nThe end of the last glacial period, around 11,700 years ago, marked a profound shift for both the planet and its human inhabitants. This transition, known as the Younger Dryas reversal in some regions, eventually led to the warming trend that ushered in the current interglacial period, the Holocene epoch. This climatic shift had immense consequences:\\n\\n*   **Melting Glaciers and Rising Sea Levels:** As the colossal ice sheets melted, vast amounts of water were released, causing global sea levels to rise dramatically. This submerged land bridges, reshaped coastlines, and created new inland seas and lakes.\\n*   **Environmental Change:** The mammoth steppes gave way to denser forests in many areas, and the tundras retreated northwards. This change in vegetation fundamentally altered the ecosystems that had supported the megafauna.\\n*   **Megafauna Extinctions:** Many of the iconic Ice Age megafauna, including woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves, and giant ground sloths, went extinct around this time. The exact causes are debated, but a combination of rapid climate change, habitat loss, and increased human hunting pressure likely played significant roles.\\n*   **Human Adaptation to a New World:** Humans, ever adaptable, responded to these changes. With the disappearance of large herd animals, hunting strategies shifted towards smaller, faster prey. The new forest environments provided different resources. This period of intense environmental change laid the groundwork for the most significant transformation in human prehistory: the Agricultural Revolution of the Neolithic era.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Two Lenses on a Shared Past\\n\\nIn summary, while the terms \"Ice Age\" and \"Prehistoric\" are often used interchangeably in popular culture, they represent distinct but deeply intertwined concepts. \"Prehistoric\" is the grand, overarching timeline of Earth and human history before the advent of writing, a vast canvas painted with the slow brushstrokes of evolution and cultural development. \"The Ice Age,\" particularly the last glacial period, is a specific, dramatic climatic event that occurred *within* that prehistoric canvas, profoundly shaping the landscapes, ecosystems, and the very trajectory of human survival and innovation.\\n\\nTo truly appreciate our ancient past, we must understand both. Prehistory provides the narrative of our ancestors\\' journey from simple hominins to complex societies. The Ice Age provides the dramatic environmental stage upon which much of that early human drama unfolded, challenging our ancestors and forging their resilience, ingenuity, and spirit. By distinguishing between these two powerful concepts, we gain a richer, more accurate understanding of the incredible story of life on Earth, and humanity\\'s remarkable place within it.\\n', 'append': False}, 'id': '3e67d3e5-b25a-4fc6-8ac0-58a493b427f4', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 4556, 'output_tokens': 4292, 'total_tokens': 8848, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1177}}), ToolMessage(content='File written successfully to ice_age_vs_prehistoric_blog.txt.', name='write_file', id='a2ff5eaa-d34e-4cb2-b667-b06191cc4637', tool_call_id='3e67d3e5-b25a-4fc6-8ac0-58a493b427f4')], 'context': {'running_summary': RunningSummary(summary=\"Our conversation began with a query about the previous winner of the Asia Cup, which was answered as India.

For millennia, the largest structures on Earth were pyramids—first the Red Pyramid in the Dashur Necropolis and then the Great Pyramid of Khufu, both in Egypt—the latter is the only extant example of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\\n\\nPage: Great Pyramid of Giza\\nSummary: The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built c.\\u20092600 BC, over a period of about 26 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Memphis and its Necropolis\". It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.\\nInitially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the world\\'s tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid\\'s height to the current 138.5 metres (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which includes an internal hillock. The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of \\u20605+1/2\\u2060 palms (a slope of 51°50\\'40\").\\nThe Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks, weighing 6 million tonnes in total. The majority of the stones are not uniform in size or shape, and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used for its construction. Other blocks were imported by boat on the Nile: white limestone from Tura for the casing, and blocks of granite from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the \"King\\'s Chamber\" structure.\\nThere are three known chambers inside of the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained unfinished. The so-called Queen\\'s Chamber and King\\'s Chamber, which contain a granite sarcophagus, are above ground, within the pyramid structure. Hemiunu, Khufu\\'s vizier, is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques, but, as is the case for other such structures, there is no definite consensus.\\nThe funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile); tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu\\'s wives; an even smaller \"satellite pyramid\"; and five buried solar barques.\\n\\nPage: Egyptian pyramids\\nSummary: The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt.', name='wikipedia', id='daa9944e-0c2a-45a5-a325-72b58530479a', tool_call_id='613a6772-c5b7-4248-a375-c8da09528e03'), AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'function_call': {'name': 'write_file', 'arguments': '{\"file_path\": \"pyramid_info.txt\", \"text\": \"Pyramid: A pyramid is a structure whose visible surfaces are triangular in broad outline and converge toward the top, making the appearance roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense.

      "hi this is Lan from Lang chain I want totalk about using Lang graph for codeGeneration Um so co- generation is oneof the really interesting applicationsof llms like we've seen projects likeGitHub co-pilot become extremely popularum and a few weeks ago a paper came outum by the folks at codium AI calledAlpha codium and this was really coolpaper in particular because itintroduced this ideaof doing code generation using what youcan think of as like flow engineering soinstead of just like an llm a codingprompt like solve this problem and asolution what it does is it generates aset of solutions ranks them so that'sfine that's like kind of standard likekind of prompt response style flow butwhat it does here that I want to drawyour attention to is if it actuallytests that code in a few different wayson public tests and on AI generatedtests and the key point is this itactually iterates and tries to improvethe solution based upon those testresults so that was reallyinteresting and a tweet came out bykarpathy on this theme which kind ofmentions hey this idea of flowengineering is a really nice Paradigmmoving away from just like naive promptanswer toflow where you can build up an answeritely over time usingtesting so it's a really nice idea andwhat's kind of cool is a few weeks agowe introduced Lang graph as a way tobuild kind of arbitrary graphs which canrepresent different kinds of flows andI've done some videos on this previouslytalking about Lang graph or things likerag where like you can do retrieval andthen you can do like a retrieval qualitycheck like grade the documents ifthey're not good you can like try toretrieve again or you can like do a websearch or something but it's a way torepresent arbitrary kind of logicalflows withllms in a lot of the same way we do withagents but the benefit of graphs is thatyou can outline a flow that's a littlebit more it's kind of like an agent withguardrails it's like you define thesteps in a very particular order andevery time you run the graph it justexecutes in thatorder so what I want to do is I want totry to implement some of the ideas fromalpha codium using L graph and we'regoing to do that right now so inparticular let's say we want to answercoding questions about some part of theLang chain documentation and for thisI'm going to choose the L chainexpression language docs so it's asubset of our docs it's around 60,000tokens and it focuses only on line chainexpression language which is basically away you can represent chains usinginline chain and we'll talk about thatin a littlebit but I want to do a few simple thingsso I want to have one what we're goingto call a node in our graph that takes aquestion and outputs an answer usingLang chain expression language docs as areference and then with that answer Iwant to be able to parse out componentsso given the answer I want to be able toparse out like the Preamble what is thisanswering the import specifically andthen the code and to do this I want touse some like a pedantic object so it'slike very nicelyformatted if I have that I can reallyeasily Implement tests for things likecheck to make sure the Imports workcheck to make sure the code executes andif either of those fail I can loop backto my generation node and say Hey tryagain here's the error Trace so againwhat they're doing in Al codium is waymore sophisticated I don't mean tosuggest we're iing imple M this as is umthis actually works on like a bunch ofpublic coding challenges it actually hastests um for each question that are bothadd and publicly available so againwe're doing something much simpler but Iwant to show how you can Implement thesekinds of ideas and you can make itarbitrarily complex if youwant so I'm going to copy over some codeinto a notebook that I have running andall I've done is I've just done some pipinstalls and I've BAS to find a fewenvironment variables for Lang Smithwhich we'll see later is prettyuseful and I'm going to call thisdocs so this is where I'm going toingest the docs related to Langexpression language and I'm going tokick off uh this right now so that'srunning so again this is using a URLloader grab all the docs sort them andclean them a little bit and here we goso here we go these are all the docsrelated to Lang and expression languageit's around 60,000 token tokens I'vemeasured it in the past so there's ourdocs now I I want to show you somethingthat's very useful um I'll call it tooluse um with open ey models and and otherLMS have similar functionality but Iwant to show you something that's reallyuseful um what I'm going to do here isshow how to build a chain that willoutput remember we talked about in ourdiagram we want three things for everysolution we want a preamble we want wantImports we want code as a structuredobject that we can like work withindividually I'll show you right herehow to do that so we're doing is we'reimporting um uh from pantic this basemodel and field and we're defining adata model for our output so I want aprefix which is just like the plainlanguage solution like here's the setupto the problem the import statement andthe code I want those as three distinctthings that I can work withlater I'll use dpd4 uh1 25 say 128context window model um and what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to take thisthis data model I'm going to turn itinto a tool and I'm going to bind it tomy model and so basically What'sHappening Here is it's going to alwaysperform a function call to attempt toOutput in this format I specify herethat's all it's happening I Define aprompt that says here's all the L cellthey're Lang CH expression languagepronounced or or substituted as LChere's all LCL docs answer the questionsstructure your output in a few ways butwhat's cool is we're always growing thatfunction call to basically try to Outputa pantic object so there we go nowwhat's nice is I can just invoke thiswith a question so let's just trythat so I'm going to sayquestion and I'm going to say how tocreate a rag chain in NLC we want torunum okay this needs to be a dict there wego boom so that'srunning now this is actually just we cansee right here we passed in all thosedocs that we previously loaded so it'slike 60,000 tokens of context and againyou think about newer long context llmslike Gemini that becomes more morefeasible to do do things like this takelike a whole a whole code base a wholeset of documentation load it and juststuff it into a model and have it sayhey answer questions about this that'sstill running now the latency isdefinitely higher because it's very verylarge context but that's fine we have alittle bit of time and we can go over toLang Smith Al this is running and have alook so we can see here was our promptokay so there you go look at this 63,000tokens you can see it's a lot of contextum that's fine and we can actually seeit all here so it's in Langs Smith um wedon't want to scroll through all thatmess but you can see we've asked aquestion we're grounding the response inall this L cell docs and we're going tohopefully output the response as apedantic object that we can play with solet's just see and okay nice it's doneso you can see our object here has aprefix um and it actually has um it'salso going to have our Imports here aswell we can actually can see that inlsmith uh the answer is going to be hereand there you go see your Imports yourcode and your prefix and these can allbe extracted from that object uh reallyeasily um so it's basically a list andit's a pantic object code and you canextract each one just like Co you knowanswer. prefix answer do uh whatever ourvariables or whatever our keys areanswer. Imports answer. code so that'sgreat so that just shows you how tooluse Works um and how we can get thestructured output out of our generationnodenow what I'm going to do here is nowthat we've established that we can dothat I'm going to start setting up ourgraph and what I'm going to do is firstI'm going to find our graph state sothis is just going to be a dictionarywhich contains things relevant to ourproblem it'll contain our code solutionit'll contain any errors and that's allwe're going toneed and here is where this is all thecode related to My Graph and we're goingto walk through this so don't worry toomuch but I just want to kind of get thisall hereso here's our code now if we go up theway to think about this is simply thisum I want to go back to my diagram hereso every node in our graph just has acorresponding function and that functionmodifies the state in some way so what'shappening is our generation node isgoing to be working with question anditeration those are the parts of statethat we want as like inputs you can seeit kind of maps to here you havequestion and you have iteration justcounts how many times you've tried thiswe'll see why that's interestinglater um this is exactly what we sawbefore data model llm tooluse all the same stuff right templatenow here's where it'sinteresting if our state contains anerror this error key what that means iswe've fed back from some of our testsand we have an error that's already beengenerated so we're retrying here's whyinteresting if we'reretrying what we're going to do isappend our prompt just like we saw abovewe're going to add something to ourprompt that says hey you tried thisbefore here was your solution we savedthat as generation key um and in ourstates you can see it's right here codesolution generation here is your errorplease retry to answer this so it's kindof like inducing a reflection based onyour priorgeneration anderror and retry so that's a veryimportant point because basically givesus that feedback from if there's amistake and either the Imports or theexecutions we're feeding that back togeneration and generation is going toretry with that information present sothat's that's all that's happening thereum and we're basically adding that tothe prompt um and we're then invokingthe chain with that error and then we'regetting a new code solution so againthat's if errors in our state dick if itisn't then we're going to go ahead andgenerate our solution just like we didabove same thing soeasy um one little thing is every timewe return the the basically we're goingto rewrite that output to the statewe're going to increment our iterationsand say Here's how many times we'vetried to answer this question that'sreally it and you can see that's all wedo return the generation return thequestion return the number of iterationseasy now here's what's kind of nice wetalked about having these two importchecks the check for imports to checkfor execution let's our check importnode just going to be really simple wehave oursolution from the solution we can getthe Imports out just like we showedabove this code solution Imports is fromour pantic object um I'll move it overso you can kind of see so a panticobject has Imports we can get theImports and all we do is just attempt toexecute the Imports if it fails we alerthey import check failed and here's thekey point we're just going to create anew key uh error in our dict identifyingthat hey there's an error present umsomething failed here and you'll seewe're going to use that later now oneother little trick if there was a priorerror in our state we're just going topend it so we do want to kind ofmaintain that um if there's like anaccumulation of errors as we runmultiple iterations we want to keepaccumulating them so we don't likerevert and make the same mistake wealready did on a future iteration sowe're going to maintain our set ofErrors now if there's no error here thenwe're going to rewrite none so we'regoing to say we're good keep going uhand basically the same thing with codeexecution right in that case we're justextracting our code and our Imports wecreate a code block of imports Plus Codetry to execute it again if it failswrite our error and append all priorerrors if it doesn't return none that'sit that's all you really need to knownow here note that we're going to do twokind of gates so we want to know if dideither of those tests fail and again allwe need to do is we can uh grab ourerror and remember if there is no errorthen if error is none keep going so herewe're at the code execution likedecision point so do you want to go tocode execution or do you want to likerevert back and retry so you can seehere if there's no error when we get tothe this point um then because we'vedone our import check if there's noerror there keep going go to codeexecution we can see we return this nodewe want to go to um and if there is anerror we can say hey return to thegenerate node so really what thesefunctions do so these are conditionaledges what these do is they do some kindof conditional check based upon like ouroutput state so again if there's anerror or not if there's no error ittells you go to this node if there is anerror it tells you go back to generatenode that's it same deal with decidingto finish again if there's no error andnow here's the iteration thing for thesake of Simplicity what I say is give itthree tries I don't want it to runarbitrarily long uh if there's no erroror if you try three times just endthat's it uh otherwise go back togenerate so again same kind of thingdecide to finished based upon um yeahbased upon whether or not there's anerror in our code execution or notthat's really it that's all we're doingso we can go down we already grabbed allthis now here is where we actuallyDefine our what we call ourworkflow um and so this is actuallywhere we defined all our edges and nodesas these functions and here's just wherewe kind of stitch them all together umso it's actually pretty straightforwardit just follows exactly like the diagramwe showed above um we like we'rebasically adding all of our nodes andwe're building our graph following thediagram that we show so we can go backto the diagram so like you can kind offollow along right set your entry pointit's generate add an edge generate checkcode Imports now our conditional Edge umso if we're going to decide to checkcode execution that was our functionhere right hereso if um basically depending on theoutput here we can decide the next nodeto go to so um if the output of thefunction says check codeexecution we go to that node if theoutput says go to generate we go back togenerate so these are where you specifythe logic of the next node you want togo to and same here so that's all we docompile it done and just map to thisdiagram um kind of like one to one sothat's actually prettystraightforward and there's just onelittle thing we now need to do uh we aregoing to goahead and try aquestion so here's a question I've I'verun a bunch of these tests already thisis a question that seems kind of randombut it's like we actually built a NEvalve set and so it's a question that wewe've sound that there's some problemswith so I want to show you why this ispretty cool I'm passing it text Key Foodin my prompt I want to process it withsome function process text how do I dothis using uh line transpressionlanguage so it's a weird question butyou'll see why it's kind of fun in ashort in a little bit and what I'm goingto do is I'm just going to run my graphso what we can see because we print outwhat happens at every step we're can tokind of follow along and see what'shappeninghere um so it's going to generatesolution now we can see this may take alittle bit because it's the same kind oflong context generation that we sawpreviously so this is now running we cango to Lang Smith and we can actuallyjust check this Lang graph and we cansee okay so it's loading up and we're atgenerate so it's actually doing thisgeneration this is still pending here isall our input docs so you can see thatum that uh you know we passed this verylarge context to our LM uh so that'scool okay so here's this is interestingso what's happening is it's goingthrough some checks so um the codeimport check worked decide to check codeexecution a decision testing codeexecutionhere's an interesting one code blockcheckfailed um decision retry so it'sactually doing aregenerationso okay let's see it looks like it cameto an answer um let's actually go andlook at what happened in our Lang graphto kind of understand what happened sowhat happened if we look at theum let's look at when weattempted yeah exactly so here let meactually pull up the errorhereum here was ourresponse um and what I want to show youis the error that we appended to ourpromptumand we can actually make this a bitfaster we canscroll this is the Crux of what I wantto show you um okay here it is so what'scool is our initial attempt to solvethis problem introduced an error therewas an execution error it unsupportedOpera for types dict and string sobasically it did something wrong and wepassed that in the prompt to the llmwhen it performs this retry so the ourinitial solution was here and it had a acoding error as noted but here you cansee we provide that error and we sayplease try to reans this structure youknow like the same instructions beforehere was uh here was the the questionand we can see okay so this is actuallythe test of code execution which nowworks we can see previously when wetried this uh it fails and this was theerror that error was passed along in theprompt like we just saw the new the newtest indeed Works our final solution isfunctionalcode that's it so you can kind of getsome intuition for the fact that whenyou have this retry Lube you can recoverfrom errors using a little bit ofreflection that's really the big idea umand again you get your answer outhere um and so there's a bunch of keysand we don't necessarily I'll show youquickly uh keys and then we can justlook at the generationkey umcool and it's going to be a list solet's just break it out so there it isthere's our code object we can seeprefix okay so there's the prefiximport uh and let's try code and heylet's just convince ourselves thisactually works so we can just run exeImports that worksexexec the code and this should work it'sdoing something there it tells a jokegreat um so this is pretty cool itinitially when to try to answer thisquestion produce an error and it thenretry by passing that error back to thecontext just like we outlined in ourgraph and on the second try it gets itcorrect so that's nice it's a goodexample of how you can do this feedbackand and reflection stuff now we actuallyhave done quite a bit more work on thisso I built an eval set of 20 Questionsrelated to Lang and expression languageand evaluated them all uh using thisapproach relative to not using Langgraph and here's the results I want tokind of draw your attention to thisbecause it's a pretty interesting resultfor the import check without Lang graphversus with Lang graph it's about thesame so Imports weren't really a problembefore this like retry reflection stuffImports were okay on oural set of 20questions I should make a note weactually ran this uh this is showingstandard errors we ran this four timesand so I basically accumulate theresults I compute standard errors youcan see that there's there's some degreeof statistical reasonable inness tothese results um in any case importchecks were were kind of fine without itbut here's a big difference there's abig difference in our code execution uhper performance with and without landgraph so before land graph if you justtry like kind of single shot answergeneration a lot of the times this waslike a 55% success rate many of thecases we saw code execution fail butwith Lang graph with this kind of retryand reflection stuff we actually can seethat the the success rate goes up toaround I believe it was 80% so it'saround like a almost a 50% Improvementin performance um with and without usingL graph so that was actually reallyimpressive and and it just shows thepower of like a very simple idea umattempting code generation with thesekinds of like just very simple checksand reflection can significantly bump upyour performance and again the alphacodium paper shows this in like a verysophisticated context but what's cool isthis is like a very simple idea you canimp Implement yourself in not much timeum and we have this all available as anotebook you can run this on any pieceof code you want so just take whateverdocuments want here Plum them in and youcan run this and you can test this outfor yourself but I've been reallyimpressed I think it's pretty cool umand in general I think lra's a reallynice way to build these kind of likereflective or self-reflectiveapplications where you can build thesefeedback loops to you can do a check ifthe check fails try again with that Fewith that uh feedbackpresent um in the retry and I'll justshow you we have a Blog coming out I'mnot sure there's anything else in thatblog I haven't already showed youum yeah not nothing really to highlightthis was our results again um this ismaybe a little bit clearer to see um butagain pretty significant Improvement inperformance simple idea uh I definitelyencourage you to experiment with this umand of course all this code will beavailable for you so um uh you know feelfree to experiment and let us know howit goes thankyou\n"
